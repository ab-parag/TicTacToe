# TicTacToe
Basic demonstration of a game Tic-Tac-Toe
# ---------
This is a first trial to implement a GUI in python 2.7

GUI: A square of 9 buttons [3x3 model] along wih 1 reset button as a GUI.
Implementation: button's text should change to 'x' or 'o' on every alternate click. On occurance of 03 signs on a stright 03 buttons calculates the result and print on a message box.

There is a bug in code. On hitting the results condition the message box doesn't show up immediatly. It waits till next click. Needs to fix this in upcoming versions.
